              The force that exists between two moving, electrically charged particles, causing them to attract or repel one another.

              From this point of view, the magnetic force <b>F</b> on the second particle is proportional to its charge q<span class="bottom">2</span>, the magnitude of its velocity v<span class="bottom">2</span>, the magnitude of the magnetic field B<span class="bottom">1</span> produced by the first moving charge, and the sine of the angle theta, θ, between the path of the second particle and the direction of the magnetic field; that is, <b>F</b> = q<span class="bottom">2</span><b>B</b><span class="bottom">1</span>v<span class="bottom">2</span> sin θ. The force is zero if the second charge is travelling in the direction of the magnetic field and is greatest if it travels at right angles to the magnetic field.

            Magnetic field intensity is the phenomena that  is used to characterize the strength of external field i.e. the magnetic field due to the external sources (electric current) only, excluding the contribution due to material’s internal magnetic field. <b>H</b> is related to <b>B</b>  through permeability μ as <b>B</b> = μ<b>H</b>. <br><br>
